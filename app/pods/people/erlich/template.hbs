  <p>
    Noted Silicon Valley entrepreneur and bon vivant Erlich Bachmann has founded both Aviato and Palo Altoâ€™s Hacker Hostel incubator, where he has nurtured talents such as Richard Hendricks and the soon-to-be famous Jian-Yang (last name unclear). He hopes to one day hybridize Cannabis Sativa with genetic material from Psylocybe Cubensis (to produce customizable hallucinations) but has already created a number of hemp-based hair enhancement products for thick, luxuriant hair (patents pending). He has attended, for various lengths of time, Berkeley, Reed and Hampshire College (B.A. in Ultimate Frisbee).
